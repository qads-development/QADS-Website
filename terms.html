        <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: October 25, 2025</p>
        <p><strong>Something you should know: </strong>Our service is based in Curaçao. We are not registered as a business, since we operate as a sole proprietorship.</p>
        <h3>1. Agreement to Terms</h3>
        <p>By accessing or using our services (the "Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use the Service. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service.</p>

You are responsible for safeguarding your password and for any activities or actions under your account, whether or not you have authorized them.</p>
        <h3>3. Subscriptions and Billing</h3>
        <p>Our services are offered on two main subscription plans: <strong>Basic</strong> and <strong>Pro</strong>. Each plan can be billed on a <strong>Monthly</strong> or <strong>Annual</strong> cycle, as selected by you at the time of purchase.</p>
        <p>All payments are processed securely by our third-party payment processor, <strong>Stripe</strong>. By subscribing, you agree to Stripe's terms of service. We do not collect or store your payment card details.</p>
        <p>You can manage your subscription, update payment methods, and view your billing history at any time through the <strong>Stripe Customer Portal</strong>, which is accessible via your account settings.</p>
        <h3>4. Plan Modifications</h3>
        <h4>4.1. Upgrades</h4>
        <p>If you choose to upgrade your plan (e.g., from Basic to Pro, or from a Monthly to an Annual plan), the change is effective <strong>immediately</strong>. You will be charged a prorated amount for the difference in cost for the remainder of your current billing cycle, and your new plan's features will be unlocked instantly.</p>
        <h4>4.2. Downgrades</h4>
        <p>If you choose to downgrade your plan (e.g., from Pro to Basic), the change will take effect <strong>immediately</strong>. Your access to features will be reduced to the new plan's level. You will <strong>not be refunded</strong> the price difference for the remainder of your current billing cycle.</p>
        <h3>5. Cancellation and Termination</h3>
        <h4>5.1. Cancellation by You</h4>
        <p>You may cancel your subscription at any time via the <strong>Stripe Customer Portal</strong>. Your cancellation will take effect at the end of your current paid billing period. You will continue to have access to the Service until the <strong>end of your current paid billing period</strong> (either the end of the month or the end of the year). We do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.</p>
        <h4>5.2. Termination by Us</h4>
        <p>We may terminate or suspend your account and bar access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms. All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.</p>
